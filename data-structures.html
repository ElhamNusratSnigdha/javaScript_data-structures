    <h1>Data Structures</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <h2>Set</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A set allows allows at least four things: add, remove, contains, and toList.</li>
            <li>Sets have no order.</li>
            <li>They're also useful for deduplication since you can only add something to a set once.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h2>Maps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Maps are quite similar to simple objects.</li>
            <li>Maps are a set/collection of keys that have values associated with those keys.</li>
            <li>Unlike objects, they don't have prototypes, inheritance, methods, or anything of that sort.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Stack</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"Last-In First-Out" (LIFO)</li>
                <li>It is an interface (a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact.) </li>
                <li>In a stack, you can only "push" (add) or "pop" (remove.) </li>
                <li>There are also "peek", which just looks at the top value of the stack without modifying the stack.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Queue</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Queues adhere to the "First-In First-Out" mantra.</li>
                <li>All stacks need to have the methods enqueue (add/push) and dequeue (remove/pop).</li>
                <li>Like stacks, they'll have peek to see what the next element is to dequeue.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
